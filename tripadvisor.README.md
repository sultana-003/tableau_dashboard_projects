# Tableau Project: TripAdvisor Hotel & User Analysis

This Tableau project analyzes TripAdvisor hotel and traveler data to evaluate hotel capacity, customer behavior, and travel patterns. The dashboard includes key performance indicators such as total number of hotels, average number of rooms, average review score, and average user reviews, providing a high-level overview of the hospitality landscape.

## To answer real business questions, I designed multiple analytical views:

1.Analyzed total orders by additional services to understand which extra amenities contribute most to customer demand

2.Identified the top 10 hotels by number of rooms to highlight high-capacity properties

3.Examined total users by continent to understand geographic distribution of travelers

4.Evaluated total hotels by star rating to compare hotel supply across quality tiers

5.Analyzed traveler types to distinguish patterns among business, family, couple, and solo travelers

6.Explored users by period of stay to identify short-term versus long-term travel behavior

This project demonstrates my ability to create calculated KPIs, solve business-driven analytical problems, and present insights through effective data visualization using Tableau.
