# Project: Netflix Content Analysis Dashboard

## Objective:
The goal of this project was to analyze Netflix’s content library and identify trends in content type, genre, release year, country, and audience rating to understand Netflix’s content strategy.
Dataset:
I used the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset from Kaggle, which includes information such as title, type, genre, country, release year, and rating.

## Approach & Tools:
Cleaned and prepared the data (handled missing values, standardized categories)
Performed exploratory analysis using Tableau
Built interactive dashboards with filters for year, genre, country, and content type

## Key Insights:
Movies make up a larger portion of Netflix’s catalog compared to TV shows
Content production increased significantly after 2015
The US and India are the top content-producing countries
Drama and International content are the most common genres
TV-MA is the most frequent rating, indicating a focus on mature audiences

## Business Value:
This dashboard helps stakeholders understand content distribution, identify popular genres, and support data-driven decisions for future content investment.


## Outcome:
The final dashboard provides a clear, interactive view of Netflix’s global content trends and can be used for strategic content planning and market analysis.
