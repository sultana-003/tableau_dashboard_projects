# Project: Video Game Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Objective:
The aim of this project was to analyze global video game sales trends, identify popular genres and platforms, and understand regional performance to support business insights for game publishing and marketing strategies.

## Dataset:
I used the vgsales dataset from Kaggle, which includes fields such as Name, Platform, Year of Release, Genre, Publisher, and Sales across regions (NA, EU, JP, Other, Global).

## Approach & Tools:

Cleaned the data and handled missing values
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python / Pandas
Built an interactive dashboard in Tableau with filters for platform, genre, year, and region

## Key Insights:

Top platforms: Certain platforms consistently dominate global sales (e.g., PS4, Nintendo).
Genre trends: Action, Shooter, and Sports games are the most popular genres.
Regional differences: Some genres perform better in specific regions (e.g., RPGs in Japan).
Sales growth: Video game sales show spikes during particular years and major releases.

## Business Value:
The dashboard provides insights for game developers and publishers to:
Focus on high-performing platforms and genres
Tailor marketing strategies for specific regions
Identify opportunities for new game releases

## Outcome:
The interactive dashboard allows users to explore sales by platform, genre, year, and region, helping decision-makers understand market trends and make data-driven strategies.
